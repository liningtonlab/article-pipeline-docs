## **Error: Please check your SMILES**
This message indicates that the SMILES you have entered is not a valid SMILES string. Some common solutions are:

1. Check for (and delete) any non SMILES-valid characters in your strings.
2. If the above doesn't do the trick, you can always re-create your SMILES using ChemDraw.
