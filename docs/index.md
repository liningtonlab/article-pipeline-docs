### 1. Prepare your Data.
Although npmrd-deposition.org is a drag and drop data deposition platform, we still ask for some preparation to be done on the NMR-data folders.
#### i) **Folder Structure**
The npmrd-deposition takes NMR-data on a compound by compound basis. In other words, we ask that each compound being submitted have its own folder which contains the NMR experiments pertaining to that compound. Below are example folders displaying the structures for folders containing data on a compound. There are three examples, one for each NMR manufacturer.

### 2. Getting a deposition link.
In order to deposit into the NPMRD, you must visit a submission link unique to their article. This link can be obtained in one of two ways depending on whether or not you have recieved an email from npmrd-deposition.org. Follow the instructions for the case that matches you.
#### i) **I recieved an email.**
Your unqiue link within the body of the email. Accessing the page is as easy as clicking the hyperlink or copy pasting it into your address bar.
#### ii) **I did NOT recieve an email.**
If you did not recieve an email you will have to search your article using it's DOI. This can be done through the npmrd-deposition [front page](http://npmrd-deposition.org/). Once on the front page, paste your article DOI into the main search bar click "Send". We will then load your unique webpage for you.
