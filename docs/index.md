# Quick User Guide
This is a quick reference guide for those users that want to know a bit more about the NPMRD Deposition Platform. For those looking to deposit recent or old articles this guide will give you all the information you need to make a quick and easy deposition. 

# Deposit your first article.
## 1. Prepare your Data.
Although npmrd-deposition.org is a drag and drop data deposition platform, we still ask for some preparation to be done on the NMR-data folders.
### i) **Folder Structure**
The npmrd-deposition takes NMR-data on a compound by compound basis. In other words, we ask that each compound being submitted have its own folder which contains the NMR experiments pertaining to that compound. Below are example folders displaying the structures for folders containing data on a compound. There are three examples, one for each NMR manufacturer.

### ii) **Zipping your data**
Once you have confirmed the data is in the correct file structure, each folder must be zipped separately. This means that if you have three compounds you should zip each of them to produce three separate zip folders. For instruction on how to zip your compound folders for each operating system see below:

## 2. Getting a deposition link.
In order to deposit into the NPMRD, you must visit a submission link unique to their article. This link can be obtained in one of two ways depending on whether or not you have recieved an email from npmrd-deposition.org. Follow the instructions for the case that matches you.
### i) **I recieved an email.**
Your unqiue link within the body of the email. Accessing the page is as easy as clicking the hyperlink or copy pasting it into your address bar.
### ii) **I did NOT recieve an email.**
If you did not recieve an email you will have to search your article using it's DOI. This can be done through the npmrd-deposition [front page](http://npmrd-deposition.org/). Once on the front page, paste your article DOI into the main search bar click "Send". We will then load your unique webpage for you.

## 3. Filling your Data.
Once your DOI has been processed you will be taken to the main deposition page. 
Here the deposition software attempts to find the compounds which are in your article and automatically fill the text fields for you. Depending on the sucess of this software your page will appear in one of two states.

### i) **Compound, Genus, and Species are pre-filled.**
 When the auto-fill process is successful, you are greeted with every compound from your paper already entered for you. From here you will need to fill the structures(SMILES) and drag and drop your zipped folders prepared in part 1.

### ii) **All fields are empty.**
When the auto-fill fails, all the text fields will appear empty. This means that it will be on you as the depositor to fill the text fields. You will also need to click the "Add +" button to create additional rows for articles that contain more than one compound. From there you will also need to fill the structures(SMILES) and drag and drop your zipped folders prepared in part 1.

This page can also appear pre-filled with multiple rows of compounds if 
Start by filling the text fields according to their prompts (Email, Compound Name, Genus, or Species).
