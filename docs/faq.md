# FAQ

## Why should I deposit my data?

- Permanent storage of your NMR data in an open, searchable platform
    - Data cannot be lost when a lab member leaves, or a hard drive fails
    - Complies with mandates from funding agencies for data deposition
- Openly accessible spectra
    - Opportunity for new collaborations with external research groups
    - Offers tools for compound dereplication
    - Provides test data for researchers creating new informatics tools for natural products discovery
    - Increased citations for your work

## Who runs the NP-MRD?

The NP-MRD is run by a research consortium led by Dr. John Cort from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). The consortium includes Professors Roger Linington (Simon Fraser University), David Wishart (University of Alberta) and Lloyd Sumner (University of Missouri). It is funded by the National Institutes of Health through the CARBON program supported by the Center for Complementary and Integrative Health and the Office of Dietary Supplements. 

## Is this a commercial database?

No. This database is maintained under FAIR principles, meaning that the data are openly and freely available for all users. The website does not have a paywall, and all data in the database are accessible users anywhere in the world.

## Why are you developing this database?

Over the last 50 years, researchers have obtained NMR data on hundreds of thousands of natural products. Unfortunately, most of these data are now irretrievably lost. A high-quality database of NMR data will create new opportunities for compound dereplication, de novo structure elucidation, and data integration strategies for bioactive natural products discovery. By contributing your NMR data you are gaining recognition for the discoveries you have made, and contributing to the body of knowledge required to advance the field of natural products discovery.

## Why is depositing data different than reporting the NMR data in a paper?

Publications typically report NMR data for natural products as NMR data tables, or as images of spectra in the Supporting Information. In both cases, significant information is lost compared to the information contained in the original raw free-induction decay (FID). Depositing the original data ensures that these data are maintained and permanently accessible to the research community.
