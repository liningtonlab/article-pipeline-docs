# Step 1: Starting Your Deposition
For those looking to deposit data with published or un-published articles, this guide will give you all the information you need to make a quick and easy deposition. 

# Starting a Deposition


## 1. Getting a deposition link.
In order to deposit into the NPMRD, you must visit a submission link unique to your deposition. This link can be obtained in one of two ways depending on whether or not you have recieved an email from npmrd-deposition.org. Follow the instructions for the case that matches you.
### i) **I recieved an email.**
Your unqiue link can be found within the body of the email. Accessing the page is as easy as clicking the hyperlink or copy pasting it into your address bar.
### ii) **I did NOT recieve an email.**
If you did not recieve an email your method of arriving at your deposition page will be based on wether or not your data is from a published article or an unpublished article. Please follow the case that applies to you below.

#### 1. My data is from a PUBLISHED article.
To get to a deposition page you will need to submit your doi through the deposition [front page](http://npmrd-deposition.org/). Once on the front page, you will first have to specify that your data is from a published article. This should load a page with a search bar where you will paste your doi and click "Submit".

Once you submit the doi, you should be brought to your unique deposition link.

#### 2. Presubmission - my data is from an UNPUBLISHED article.
To get to your deposition page from here you will have to select the UNPUBLISHED option on the [front page](http://npmrd-deposition.org/). This will take you to another page where you will be prompted to enter information about your unpublished article.
